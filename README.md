# PyTorch best practices template

PyTorch seems to include a lot of boilerplate compared to something like
Keras, and this boilerplate is often straightforward between (simple)
models. Here I will try to structure a simple PyTorch model that I like
which I can use as a template for future training and evaluation loops,
etc.
